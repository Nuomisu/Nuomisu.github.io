introduction: 'My lab website on CP3101b <The wandering cat>. It is a funny and simple web application',
content: 'This semester, I take module CP3101b Web Programming and Applications.\n\nSo far, we have finished seven labs to create a simple game web application called the wandering cat(http://cp3101b.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lshumin/lab7/). On this webiste, there is a 5x5 2D grid world, lives a small cat and his mother cat.They stay in one of the cell in the gridâ€”their home.There are lots of obstacles in the 2D grid world. The small cat wants to explore this 2D grid world with his mother cat in a certain order: river, garden, library and home. Cats can move up, down, left and right. Player need to find a path that can pass all places in order. Pressing new puzzle button will start the game. After you starting, solition button can show the current best path. Once user finishs the game, the number of steps will be recorded. Users can sign up an account, but their scores are saved only their scores are the best.\n\nIn this website, I use html5, jquery, CSS, php and mySQL. When user start a new game, client side will ask a puzzle from server. If user want to get a solution, server side will calculate the best path and return the path to client. Users information such as name and password are stored in mySQL database. Best scores are also stored in database.\n\nFinally, I also add google analytics and facebook like. In the rest of this semester, we will take a group project about NUS IVLE dropboc sync. I will talk about in the future.'

title: 'Mesh simplification',

introduction: 'From 3D modeling and animation. Use edge collapse to do mesh simplification.',
content: 'This is assignment one from CS3242 3D Modeling and Animation. In this assignment, we are required to implement a mesh simplification algorithm that can reduce the number of faces in a triangle mesh. Its language is C++.\n\nBasic I/O functions that can read and write a .mesh data file has been given. Input includes a mesh and number of faces after simplification. I use edge collapse as my core operation to simplify the mesh. First I design my data structure. There are three classes here: mesh, face, and vertex. One mesh contain a list of faces and a list of vertices. Face is a triangle, so in the face class, there are three vertex and one normal vector. For one vertex, it contains its position, its index, its neighbor vertices, its adjacent faces, collapsed cost and candidate vertex for collapse. Its collapsed cost is calculated by normal vectors of its adjacent faces. Formula details can be found in this paper "A Simple, Fast, and Effective Polygon Reduction Algorithm".\n\nThe main idea of mesh simplification is to delete the vertex with minimal collapsed cost until the number of faces is smaller or equal to the input number. When one vertex is going to be removed, one of its neighbor vertex will replace its position so that its adjacent faces can still exist and its other neighbor vertices still has same amount of neighbors. Result pictures are shown in my project session.'
